<h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>

<p> My final project idea is a game of rock, paper, scissors, which you can play vs. the computer by using hand gestures.</p>

<h2>My Plan</h2>

**Week One** 
- [ ] Learn about and implement opencv library, to recgonize hand gestures --> https://opencv.org 
- [ ] Figure out how to implement TensorFlow for image recognition 
- [ ] Plan out how the camera will detect the hand (find out how to connect webcam to xcode and how to launch it), and how to train it to capture the 3 gestures
- [ ] If I get this far, start training the program 

**Week Two** 
- [ ] Continue training the program
- [ ] Start implementing recognition, and get it to work.

**Week Three** 
- [ ] Implement recognizing symbols and train model, 
- [ ] Figure out game window, make graphics for game (gui, show move by each player and keep score)
- [ ] If time allows -> make cool annimation for computer playing it's move

**Week Four** 

These are ambitious deadlines. I'll need more time to catch up and add whatever else I find that I need along the way. 
And update readme to describe project and not show plan.
